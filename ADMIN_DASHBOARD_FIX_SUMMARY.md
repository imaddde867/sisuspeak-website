# 🔧 Admin Dashboard Fixed - Password Input Now Visible!

## ✅ Issue Resolved

### **Problem Fixed**
The admin dashboard password input had **white text on white background**, making it impossible to see what you were typing. This has been completely resolved!

```css
/* BEFORE - Invisible text */
className="w-full px-4 py-3 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"

/* AFTER - Visible text with brand colors */
className="w-full px-4 py-3 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#7388a5] focus:border-[#7388a5] bg-white text-gray-900 placeholder-gray-500"
